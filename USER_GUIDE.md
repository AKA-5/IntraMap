## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### "Can't pan/drag the map"
**Fixed!** This was a bug in v1.0. Make sure you have the latest version (v2.0+).

**Desktop:**
- Click and drag on empty space (not on objects)
- Or hold Space key and drag anywhere

**Mobile:**
- Touch and drag with one finger
- Make sure you're not accidentally zooming (two fingers)

#### "Zoom buttons not showing"
The zoom buttons are always visible in the bottom-right corner.

If you don't see them:

#### "My changes aren't saving"
Make sure to:
1. Click **☁️ Save to Cloud** (not just draft save)
2. Wait for confirmation message
3. Save your building ID/link

Check if:
1. Object has a Label in properties panel
2. Object has Tags for alternate keywords
3. You're searching the right floor
4. Spelling matches label or tags
